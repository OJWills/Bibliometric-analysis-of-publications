# Author-Name-Disambiguator

### Description 
This repository provides Python code to disambiguate author names using fuzzy matching. The code pulls in author names from publications, generates all possible combinations and uses fuzzy matching to flag names which may be the same for example John Smith and J Smith. Part-way through the programme there is an optional pause for the user to manually validate the matches if required. A more effective approach could be to use relational machine learning as discussed here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7891792.
